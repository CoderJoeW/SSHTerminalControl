# SSHTerminalControl
 SSH Control for winforms. Meant to replace expensive controls like ComponentPro

 ##Important
 We have come a decent way from what I believe is out there at the moment but we still have a long way to go

 Usage:
Compile this project and add the resulting dll to your winforms project. Build the solution and you will see the control in your toolbox
